Overall, this project really helped me understand the use of the new contains that we learned about in OOP345, including <vector> and <deque>.
Furthermore, the use of algorithms and container member functions greatly simplifies code incomparison to working with dynamic arrays. 
For example, in the LineManager constructor, it was relatively simple to use the find_if() algorithm to set the "nextStation" to the corresponding station.

One tricky thing I ran into in completing this milestone was in the LineManager::run() and Workstation::attemptToMoveOrder() functions.
At first, I was simply "moving" the orders to a different container, but I was not doing anything about the spot left in the container. 
This was causing memory issues for me. I realized that I would have to use the erase() member function to remove the "moved" position, and then the erase() function would actually take care of re-ordering the rest of the container automatically. 

Overall, this project was really good for my learning experience.
