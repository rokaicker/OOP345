I beleive that the main benefit in using binary files is that there is no interpretation required on the text received (in terms of delimiters, etc.).
We just have to worry about how many bytes certain pieces of data take. 
The advantages of binding a function to arguments is that if have a function that takes a parameter, that will be constant for every run of the function in the program, we can just bind that parameter to the function without having to use that parameter everytime. 

The main advantage of using multiple threads is the time saving in handling large computations. Whent he program ran on a single thread, my computer took about 4000 ms to solve it, then with 2 threads the time to solve dropped by more than half to about 1500 ms. 
Multithreading was accomplished in this lab by creating a vector of threads, splitting the data into partitions, then passing the function object with the data range to the thread to be completed as its task.
At the end, once the task was completed, all the threads were joined back to get the final data.
